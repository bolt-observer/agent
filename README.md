Agent works with LND and CoreLightning and tries the best to have sane defaults so you can just start it up on your node without further hassle.

Example:
```
bolt-agent --apikey key
```

Only thing that is mandatory is the apikey which can also be provided through `API_KEY` environment variable:
```
export API_KEY=changeme
bolt-agent
```

Agent is using `glog` library for logging which needs writable `/tmp` (use `--logtostderr` to prevent writing to filesystem).

Flag `--private` means whether you want to report data for private ("unannounced") channels too (when true). The default is false.
There is an advanced option of filtering what channels exactly are reported documented in "Filtering on agent side" section.

For more information about what exactly is reported read [DATA.md](./DATA.md).

#### Advanced options

If you have a custom LND directory (`/storage` in the example) you might need:

```
bolt-agent --lnddir /storage/lnd/ --tlscertpath /storage/lnd/data/secrets/lnd.cert
```

but that should be it.

By default it will try to communicate with LND using local gRPC connection and `readonly.macaroon`.

You can use `--userest` to start using REST API - in that case `--rpcserver` can be complete URL to the endpoint.

```
bolt-agent --userest --rpcserver https://bolt.observer/endpoint
```

For CoreLightning it will use UNIX domain socket. By default agent will try to use `~/.lightning/bitcoin/lightning-rpc`.
If that file exists program will default to CoreLightning so if have LND installed on the node too and do not want to use CLN there is a flag
`--ignorecln`. You can manually override name of UNIX domain socket using `--rpcserver` flag.
Example:

```
bolt-agent --rpcserver /storage/cln/socket
```

Make sure agent is running with correct permissions to access the socket.

There is support for remote connections via commando plugin but you cannot use that option via command-line flags at the moment. We suggest to use
`socat` utility if you wish to monitor a remote CLN node.

## Install

We provide a standalone statically compiled binary. The targets are `linux` (amd64 build for GNU/Linux), `rasp` (aarch64 build for GNU/Linux) suitable for installation on your Raspberry PI and `darwin` (amd64 build for MacOS).
If you need some different architecture that is no problem except that you will have to build the binaries yourself (so you will need to install Golang). You can also open an issue / pull request to extend the defaults (or provide better naming).

### Nix

If you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/) with [flake support](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) you can do:
```
nix profile install 'github:bolt-observer/agent'
```

### Script

Else you can run:
```
curl https://bolt.observer/agent | sh
```

to install the latest version of agent.

The executed script is present [here](./install.sh) so you can first check what it does. Or you can also do a manual installation.

### Manual installation steps

Script will execute same steps that you can invoke manually:

* fetch latest revision from https://github.com/bolt-observer/agent/releases

```
wget https://github.com/bolt-observer/agent/releases/download/v0.1.1/bolt-agent-v0.1.1-linux.zip https://github.com/bolt-observer/agent/releases/download/v0.1.1/manifest-v0.1.1.txt.asc https://github.com/bolt-observer/agent/releases/download/v0.1.1/manifest-v0.1.1.txt
```

* verify integrity

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bolt-observer/agent/main/scripts/keys/fiksn.asc | gpg --import
gpg --verify manifest-v0.1.1.txt.asc manifest-v0.1.1.txt
```

and you should see:
```
gpg:                using RSA key F4B8B3B59C1E5AA39A1B9636E897355718E1DBF4
gpg: Good signature from "Gregor Pogacnik <gregor@bolt.observer>" [ultimate]
```

* unpack the compressed binary

```
unzip bolt-agent-v0.1.1-linux.zip
```

* copy the binary to a common place

```
cp bolt-agent-v0.1.1-linux /usr/local/bin/bolt-agent
```

* start the binary

```
bolt-agent -apikey changeme
```

* you may want to run the agent as a systemd service (we have a simple systemd template [here](./bolt-agent.service))

You need to do that only once:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bolt-observer/agent/main/bolt-agent.service
cp bolt-agent.service /etc/systemd/system/bolt-agent.service
$EDITOR /etc/systemd/system/bolt-agent.service # to change API_KEY
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable bolt-agent
systemctl start bolt-agent
```

## Docker

You can use the docker image from GitHub:

Usage:

```
docker run -v /tmp:/tmp -e API_KEY=changeme ghcr.io/bolt-observer/agent:v0.1.1
```

## Filtering on agent side

You can limit what channnels are reported using `--channel-whitelist` option. It specifies a local file path to be used as a whitelist of what channels to report.
Channel IDs are short channel identifiers in LND format (a valid id is `792080480214450176` but not `720393x2228x0`)
When adding `--private` to `--channel-whitelist` this means every private channel AND whatever is listed in the file. There is also `--public` to allow all public channels.
Using the options without `--channel-whitelist` makes no sense since by default all public channels are reported however it has to be explicit with `--channel-whitelist` in order
to automatically allow all public channels (beside what is allowed through the file).
If you set `--private` and `--public` then no matter what you add to the `--channel-whitelist` file everything will be reported.

The file looks like this:

```
# Comments start with a # character
# You can list pubkeys for example:
0288037d3f0bdcfb240402b43b80cdc32e41528b3e2ebe05884aff507d71fca71a # bolt.observer
# which means any channel where peer pubkey is this
# or you can specify a specific short channel id e.g.,
759930760125546497
# too, invalid lines like
whatever
# will be ignored (and logged as a warning, aliases also don't work!)
# Validity for channel id is not checked (it just has to be numeric), thus:
1337
# is perfectly valid (altho it won't match and thus allow the reporting of
# any additional channel).
# Empty files means nothing - in whitelist context: do not report anything.
```

## Components

Internally we use:
* [nodedata](./nodedata): an abstraction for running the periodic checks and reporting balance related changes
* [filter](./filter): this is used to filter specific channels on the agent side
* [checkermonitoring](./checkermonitoring): is used for reporting metrics via Graphite (not used directly in bolt-agent here)
* [lightning](./lightning): an abstraction around lightning node API (that furthermore heavily depends on common code from [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd))
* [lnsocket](./lnsocket): a way to establish a commando connection with CLN nodes
* [agent](./agent): is the GRPC client for reporting payment data
* [actions](./actions): is the GRPC client for getting what actios to invoke
* [raw](./raw): is the connection between [agent](./agent) API and [lightning](./lightning) API
* [plugins](./plugins): contains the plugins

## Dependencies

This code depends on some [common code](https://github.com/bolt-observer/go_common).

## Troubleshooting

Do:
```
go get -v github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd@v0.15.4-beta
```
or else you get an ancient version and everything breaks (should be good due to go.mod/sums now).
