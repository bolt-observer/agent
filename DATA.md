# What kind of data does the agent report?

You can always check by running it with following flags, which forces a dry-run (without sending anything to the server)

```
--url "" --verbosity 2
```

basically it will report a JSON similar to https://api.lightning.community/#getnodeinfo every 10 minutes except that if you allow private data to be reported (`--private`) also unnanounced channels are included. The only additional
field is `timestamp` in UNIX time. We use that data so the information about a node is available (in case gossip data has not arrived yet or won't arrive when node is private).

```

and then upon every change (configurable poll interval) it will report something like:

```

  "poll_interval": "10s",
  "allowed_entropy": 64,
  "allow_private_channels": false,
  "chain": "bitcoin",

    ...
   ],
  "closed_channels": [
    { "channel_id": 754581636042522626 }
  ]
  }
```

`poll_interval` is the setting how often to poll for changes and `allowed_entropy` is the entropy in bits that you can also specify via `--allowedentropy` flag.
`local_nominator / denominator` is the fraction of how much balance is on your side and `remote_nominator / denominator` is on the other side of the channel.
If you use a high enough entropy `denominator` is same as `capacity` in satoshis and thus the `nominator` values can then be interpreted as satoshis.
note that `local + remote balance` is not necessary equal to `capacity` due to channel reserve and other factors.

`nominator` and `nominator_diff` are deprecated and will be removed soon.
